# About the project 

The project is a responsive modern website for a fictive jewellery shop. The website uses HTML5(semantic, accessible and image optimization for different viewports and device pixel ratio ), SASS(with scss files), some CSS interactive elements and Javascript.

The application includes two pages: home page and catalog products.
